## Java Methods

## SavingsAccount

```
public class SavingsAccount {
  
  int balance;
  
  public SavingsAccount(int initialBalance){
    balance = initialBalance;
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    SavingsAccount savings = new SavingsAccount(2000);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Withdrawing:
    int afterWithdraw = savings.balance - 300;
    savings.balance = afterWithdraw;
    System.out.println("You just withdrew "+300);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
    //Deposit:
    int afterDeposit2 = savings.balance + 600;
    savings.balance = afterDeposit2;
    System.out.println("You just deposited "+600);
    
    //Check balance:
    System.out.println("Hello!");
    System.out.println("Your balance is "+savings.balance);
    
  }       
}
```

We have made a SavingsAccount class without using any methods beyond main() and the constructor, SavingsAccount().

Run the code to see some account behavior happen.

Look at the main method! Itâ€™s so long! There is so much repeated code! Can you imagine how messy it would look if you needed to make 10 deposits?

Throughout this lesson, we will learn how to make methods that would make checking the balance, depositing, and withdrawing all behavior that would take only one line of code.

## Store

```
public class Store {
  // instance fields
  String productType;
  
  // constructor method
  public Store(String product) {
    productType = product;
  }
  
  // advertise method
  
  // main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
```

In between the constructor and the main() method, add a method called advertise() to the Store class. It should be accessible by other classes, and should have no output.

You can leave the body of the method empty.
