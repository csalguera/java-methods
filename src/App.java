     * Introduction
     * ------------
     * 
     * In the last lesson, we learned objects have state and behavior
     * We give objects state via instance fields
     * 
     * We're going to create object behavior using methods
     * 
     * Methods are repeatable, modular blocks of code used to accomplish specific tasks
     * 
     * We can define our own methods that will take input and return the kind of output we want
     * 
     * Procedural abstractions is the knowledge of what a method does, its end result, without fully knowing how it accomplishes it
